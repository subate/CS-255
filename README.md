Work for CS-255
The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted an online system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The system needed features for students to schedule lessons, take practice tests, and track progress, while also supporting instructors and administrators who manage the lessons.

I think I did well in creating clear UML diagrams and organizing the system design to match the client’s needs. The use case and class diagrams helped make the structure easy to understand. If I could revise one part, I’d make the activity diagrams simpler and add more details about what happens when errors occur.

To meet user needs, I focused on how students, instructors, and admins would use the system in real life and made sure their goals were represented in the design. Considering user needs is important because it makes the system more useful and intuitive.

When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and mapping out how users interact with the system before moving to implementation. In the future, I plan to keep using visual tools like UML diagrams and involve users early in the design process to make sure the system fits their expectations.
